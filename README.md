## Project Overview 🎯

This project demonstrates advanced sentiment analysis techniques using Python, comparing traditional lexicon-based approaches with modern deep learning methods. By comparing VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) with RoBERTa, we showcase the strengths and weaknesses of different sentiment analysis approaches.

## Key Features ✨

- Implementation of two powerful sentiment analysis techniques
- Comprehensive comparison of traditional and modern approaches
- Real-world application using Amazon product reviews
- Interactive visualizations and analysis
- Code-ready with detailed documentation

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python 3.7+**
- **NLTK** for traditional NLP tasks
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for state-of-the-art models
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **PyTorch** for deep learning operations

## Installation 📦

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-python.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd sentiment-analysis-python

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage 🔍

1. Open `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
2. Follow the step-by-step analysis process
3. Experiment with your own text data
4. Compare results between VADER and RoBERTa
